   8  Distal part of the tail = alternation of dark and bright rings -> Genetta johnstoni
                              = several bright terminal rings are covered with dark -> Genetta bourloni

  10  Ventral inflation of the caudal entotympanic bone (ceb) = strong (twice as much inflated than ectotympanic bone) -> Genetta maculata, Genetta "letabae"
